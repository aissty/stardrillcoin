## What is Stardrillcoin?

Stardrillcoin is an inexpensive and decentralized ledger for businesses to track share ownership and distribute dividends in an automated fashion. SDC can be transferred and held like other cryptocurrency units, such as peercoins and bitcoins.

Each business using Stardrillcoin will have their own blockchain that is independent of all others. Blockchains can be secured cheaply and easily using Peercoin's proof-of-stake once the initial (issuer-controlled) quantity of SDC have been generated using proof-of-work.

Using Stardrillcoin, individuals, businesses, or organizations of any size can raise funding through an initial offering without depending on a third party such as a stock exchange. While trading SDCs through exchanges will be more liquid, Stardrillcoin can be traded on any number of exchanges just as Peercoins can. 

Issuers can distribute dividends as in Peercoins. Dividends can be held by investors, or can be converted to another cryptocurrency or fiat through their preferred exchange.

A share issuer is not vulnerable to the failure of single stock exchange such as BTC Trading or Litecoin Global.

### About Peercoin
[Peercoin](http://peercoin.net/) (abbreviated PPC), also known as PPCoin and Peer-to-Peer Coin is the first [cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) design introducing [proof-of-stake consensus](http://peercoin.net/bin/peercoin-paper.pdf) as a security model, with a combined [proof-of-stake](http://peercoin.net/bin/peercoin-paper.pdf)/[proof-of-work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system) minting system. Peercoin is based on [Bitcoin](http://bitcoin.org/en/), while introducing many important innovations to cryptocurrency field including new security model, energy efficiency, better minting model and more adaptive response to rapid change in network computation power.

# Repo Guidelines

* Developers work in their own forks, then submit pull requests when they think their feature or bug fix is ready.
* If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the development team members simply pulls it.
* If it is a more complicated or potentially controversial change, then the change may be discussed in the pull request, or the requester may be asked to start a discussion [Peercoin Talk](http://www.peercointalk.org/) for a broader community discussion. 
* The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing. Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if they don't match the project's coding conventions (see coding.txt) or are controversial.
* From time to time a pull request will become outdated. If this occurs, and the pull is no longer automatically mergeable; a comment on the pull will be used to issue a warning of closure.  Pull requests closed in this manner will have their corresponding issue labeled 'stagnant'.
* For development ideas and help see [here](http://www.peercointalk.org/index.php?board=10.0).
